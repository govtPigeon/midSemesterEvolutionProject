# midSemesterEvolutionProject
fun project in between semesters involving evolutionary algorithms

line 158 in test.py should be updated with the tsp file you want to use. there's definitely optimization to be done with the current release (perhaps combining parents 
that have better fitness aka lower costs?) seems to work well for some and not so great for others but I think that's more down to luck.. unfortunately.

regarding the tsp files, they can be copy pasted into a text file and they should work as is. I didn't have trouble with any of them.
